# Micro Delay

## Description

**microdelay** is a delay matrix with two delay lines. There are two delay lines: LA and LB.
There are 11 parameters:

- Send from input to output (Dry Level)
- Send from input to LA
- Send from input to LB
- Send from LA to output
- Send from LA to LA (LA Feedback)
- Send from LA to LB
- LA delay time
- Send from LB to output
- Send from LB to LB (LB Feedback)
- Send from LB to LA
- LB delay time

Every send parameter takes values from -1 to 1.

Every delay time parameter takes values from 0.025 milliseconds to 16000.00 milliseconds.

## TODO

- [ ] Improve GUI:
    - [ ] Realize self-made GUI like Delay.png
    - [ ] add self-made knobs
- [ ] Add Pan knobs (it's useful to make haas effect)
- [ ] Add Filters

## Compiling

To compile it to bundle, use this command:
\```sh
cargo run --package xtask --release bundle microdelay
\```

## Dependencies
